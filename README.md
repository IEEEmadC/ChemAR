This Android Application intends to make the study of chemistry fun and easy by visualizing 3D molecular structures right at your desk with Augmented Reality. The 3D models may be loaded by scanning QR Code which can be embedded in textbooks, websites, etc. Also models can be searched and downloaded from online databases.
